0,"@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic"
0,"@AmericanAir Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?"
0,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
0,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
0,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
0,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
0,@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
0,"@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport"
0,"@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!"

0,@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
0,@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour
0,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
0,@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
0,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!

0,@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
0,@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!

0,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
0,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
0,@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
0,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?

0,@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
0,"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"

0,@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
0,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
0,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
0,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
0,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
0,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
0,@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
0,@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
0,@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
0,"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
0,@AmericanAir Close down
0,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
0,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
0,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
0,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
0,@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
0,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
0,@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
0,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
0,@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
0,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
0,"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or...."
0,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
0,@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
0,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
0,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
0,"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got"
0,@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
0,@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
0,@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
0,"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
0,"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?"
0,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
0,@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
0,@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
0,@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
0,@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
0,@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
0,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
0,@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
0,@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
0,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane üò¢üòïüò¶ #AmericanAirlines"
0,"@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams."
0,"@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
0,@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
0,@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
0,"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"
0,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
0,"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
0,"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
0,"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting"
0,@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
0,@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
0,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
0,@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
0,"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
0,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
0,@AmericanAir She got to the gate just in time to watch the plane push back. 5 minutes was all she needed. Glad we‚Äôve relatives nearby.
0,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
0,@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
0,@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
0,"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful üò≥"
0,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
0,@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you‚Äôve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
0,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"
0,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
0,@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
0,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
0,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y‚Äôall hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
0,"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
0,@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
0,"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
0,@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
0,@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
0,@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
0,@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
0,"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
0,"@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ"
